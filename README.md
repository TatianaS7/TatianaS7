# Hi, I'm Tatiana! ðŸ‘‹
### Fullstack Software Engineer

I transitioned to Software Engineering after majoring in Business Administration, only to realize that my true passion was in the technical side of thingsâ€”particularly in web design and app development. I found myself more excited about the possibilities of how a platform would look and work, rather than the business side of things. This led me to explore **User Experience Design (UXD)**, where I discovered that I had been naturally creating wireframes and focusing on user requirements long before I knew what UXD was.

In **August 2021**, I took a 6-month course through **eCornell**, where I further honed my UXD skills and applied them to my passion project, [uCreate](https://github.com/TatianaS7/uCreate). This course inspired me to take things to the next level and learn how to **code** so I could develop the platform myself.

In **January 2023**, I joined a **bootcamp** through **Year Up** and **Pluralsight**, focusing on Frontend Development. During the bootcamp, I worked on several projects with a team of talented developers. I then ventured into **Backend Development** on my own, exploring **MySQL** and **Node.js** to further build out **uCreate** while applying my Frontend skills.

Fast forward to **January 2024**, I began an apprenticeship through **Multiverse** and **McKinsey & Company** in **Software Engineering**. This experience has deepened my understanding of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** and the collaborative, thoughtful process of building software beyond just the coding aspect. I am thrilled to be learning from some of the brightest minds in the industry!
